# PixelWeather Configuration Generator for Home Assistant

A tool for easily generating configuration files containing entity configurations all of your PixelWeather nodes. This allows you to integrate your PixelWeather nodes with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), a FOSS home automation system. All sensor data is pulled from the same database as the one used by the [PWMP server](https://github.com/PixelWeatherProject/pwmp-server).

This tool requires a pre-configured database (see [this](https://github.com/PixelWeatherProject/pwmp-server)). Since the PWMP server only supports PostgreSQL, this tool also has the same restriction.

## CLI
```
Home Assistant configuration generator for PixelWeather.

Usage: pw-hassgen [OPTIONS] --username <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD> --database <DATABASE> <HOST> <COMMAND>

Commands:
  generate  Generate YAML configuration
  help      Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Arguments:
  <HOST>  Database Host

Options:
      --port <PORT>          Database Port [default: 5432]
  -u, --username <USERNAME>  Database username
  -p, --password <PASSWORD>  Database password
  -d, --database <DATABASE>  Database name
  -h, --help                 Print help
  -V, --version              Print version
```
The `generate` command provides additional options for more customization.

## Caveats
- **All database connection info (incl. username and password) are stored in plain-text! Unfortunately, as of now, Home Assistant does NOT provide an alternative solution.**
- Currently, it's not possible to read **nor** change node settings.
